            It's been a fun month so far with you, and I can't wait to be spending more time with the love of my life. I made this thing in the span of ~1 hour, so it's not much, but I hope you like it. I love you so so much and I wish the best for you : )

        <p>
            I may not be your first love, but I want to be your last everything. I want to hold hands with you as we go through this life together, and I want to be the one you come home to at the end of the day. I want to be the one you laugh with, cry with, and grow old with. I want to be the one you love forever.
